## Science vs. Power 

> “THE DREAM of reason did not take power into account. The dream was
> that reason, in the form of arts and sciences, would liberate humanity
> from scarcity and the caprices of nature, ignorance and superstition,
> tyranny, and not least of all, the diseases of the body and the
> spirit. But reason is no abstract force pushing inexorably toward
> greater freedom at the end of history. Its forms and users are
> determined by the narrower purposes of men and women; there interests
> and ideals shape even that counts as knowledge. Though the works of
> reason have lifted innumerable burdens of hunger and sorrow, they have
> also cast up a new world of power. In that world, some people stand
> above others in knowledge and authority and in control of the vast
> institutions that have arisen to manage and finance the rationalized
> forms of human labor.”

  - Paul Starr

## Game Theory

> *The first theme is that society is a game with rules, people are
> players in this game, and politics is the arena in which we affirm and
> change these rules. Unlike the rules in standard game theory, however,
> social rules are continually contested by players allying to scrap old
> rules and create new rules to serve their purposes.*
>
> *Rule contestation is conflictual. People do not always agree on what
> rules should govern their lives. Societies usually have rules
> concerning how the rules themselves get changed, but people do not
> always play by the rules when they want to change the rules.
> Individuality is central to our species because the rules do not
> change through inexorable macrosocial forces or through a biochemical
> dynamic of gene substitution. Rather, individuals band together to
> change the rules.*
>
> *Everything distinctive about human social life flows from the fact
> that we construct and then play social games. Other animals are
> playful, but they do not make up the games they play. They do not
> change the rules of the game to suit their purposes. Similarly, other
> animals live in societies. But the rules of the game for nonhuman
> societies are inscribed in the genome of the species, while ours is
> not. Other animals do not change these rules to suit their purposes.
> We do.*

## Government 

> There is nobody in this country who got rich on his own. Nobody.

> You build a factory out there—good for you!

> But I want to be clear. You moved your good to market on the roads the
> rest of us paid for. You hired workers the rest of us paid to educate.
> You were safe in your factory because of police forces and fire forces
> that the rest of us paid for. You didn’t have to worry that marauding
> bands would come and seize everything at your factory, and hire someone
> to protect against this, because of the work the rest of us did. Now
> look, you built a factory and it turned into something terrific, or a
> great idea—God bless. Keep a big hunk of it.

> But part of the underlying social contract is you take a hunk of that
> and pay forward for the next kid who comes along.

- Elizabeth Warren
