# Buddhism  

> "Just take it day by day"

- Common saying, at least in the US

#

> If a problem is fixable, if a situation is such that you can do something about it, then there is no need to worry. If it's not fixable, then there is no help in worrying. There is no benefit in worrying whatsoever.  

- Dalai Lama
#

> Remember, tomorrow is promised to no one.

- Walter Payton

#

>When we meet real tragedy in life, we can react in two ways--either by losing hope and falling into self-destructive habits, or by using the challenge to find our inner strength.

- Dalai Lama

#

> Hope is important because it can make the present moment less difficult to bear. If we believe that tommorow will be better, we can bear a hardship today

- Thich Nhat Hanh

> There is a Taoist story of an old farmer who had worked his crops for many years. One day his horse ran away. Upon hearing the news, his neighbors came to visit. “Such bad luck,” they said sympathetically.

> “Maybe,” the farmer replied.

> The next morning the horse returned, bringing with it three other wild horses. “How wonderful,” the neighbors exclaimed.

> “Maybe,” replied the old man.

> The following day, his son tried to ride one of the untamed horses, was thrown, and broke his leg. The neighbors again came to offer their sympathy for what they called his “misfortune.”

> “Maybe,” answered the farmer.

> The day after, military officials came to the village to draft young men into the army. Seeing that the son's leg was broken, they passed him by. The neighbors congratulated the farmer on how well things had turned out.

> “Maybe,” said the farmer.



# Science vs. Power 

> “THE DREAM of reason did not take power into account. The dream was
> that reason, in the form of arts and sciences, would liberate humanity
> from scarcity and the caprices of nature, ignorance and superstition,
> tyranny, and not least of all, the diseases of the body and the
> spirit. But reason is no abstract force pushing inexorably toward
> greater freedom at the end of history. Its forms and users are
> determined by the narrower purposes of men and women; there interests
> and ideals shape even that counts as knowledge. Though the works of
> reason have lifted innumerable burdens of hunger and sorrow, they have
> also cast up a new world of power. In that world, some people stand
> above others in knowledge and authority and in control of the vast
> institutions that have arisen to manage and finance the rationalized
> forms of human labor.”
>
  - Paul Starr

# Game Theory

> The first theme is that society is a game with rules, people are
> players in this game, and politics is the arena in which we affirm and
> change these rules. Unlike the rules in standard game theory, however,
> social rules are continually contested by players allying to scrap old
> rules and create new rules to serve their purposes.*
>
> Rule contestation is conflictual. People do not always agree on what
> rules should govern their lives. Societies usually have rules
> concerning how the rules themselves get changed, but people do not
> always play by the rules when they want to change the rules.
> Individuality is central to our species because the rules do not
> change through inexorable macrosocial forces or through a biochemical
> dynamic of gene substitution. Rather, individuals band together to
> change the rules.
>
> *Everything distinctive about human social life flows from the fact
> that we construct and then play social games. Other animals are
> playful, but they do not make up the games they play. They do not
> change the rules of the game to suit their purposes. Similarly, other
> animals live in societies. But the rules of the game for nonhuman
> societies are inscribed in the genome of the species, while ours is
> not. Other animals do not change these rules to suit their purposes.
> We do.

-   Herb Gintis

# Government 

> There is nobody in this country who got rich on his own. Nobody.

> You build a factory out there—good for you!

> But I want to be clear. You moved your good to market on the roads the
> rest of us paid for. You hired workers the rest of us paid to educate.
> You were safe in your factory because of police forces and fire forces
> that the rest of us paid for. You didn’t have to worry that marauding
> bands would come and seize everything at your factory, and hire someone
> to protect against this, because of the work the rest of us did. Now
> look, you built a factory and it turned into something terrific, or a
> great idea—God bless. Keep a big hunk of it.

> But part of the underlying social contract is you take a hunk of that
> and pay forward for the next kid who comes along.

- Elizabeth Warren

# Change

> And it never failed that during the dry years the people forgot about the rich years, and during the wet years they lost all memory of the dry years.  

> It was always that way. 

- John Steinbeck, East of Eden

## Inflation 

- "See, what everyone is not including in the conversation is what really causes inflation, which is too many people with too much money chasing too few goods," Bill Smead, chief investment officer at Smead Capital Management, told CNBC's "Squawk Box Europe" on Thursday.
