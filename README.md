## Science vs. Power 

> “THE DREAM of reason did not take power into account. The dream was
> that reason, in the form of arts and sciences, would liberate humanity
> from scarcity and the caprices of nature, ignorance and superstition,
> tyranny, and not least of all, the diseases of the body and the
> spirit. But reason is no abstract force pushing inexorably toward
> greater freedom at the end of history. Its forms and users are
> determined by the narrower purposes of men and women; there interests
> and ideals shape even that counts as knowledge. Though the works of
> reason have lifted innumerable burdens of hunger and sorrow, they have
> also cast up a new world of power. In that world, some people stand
> above others in knowledge and authority and in control of the vast
> institutions that have arisen to manage and finance the rationalized
> forms of human labor.”
>
> Paul Starr
